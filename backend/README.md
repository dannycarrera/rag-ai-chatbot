# RAG AI Chatbot - Python Flask Backend

The backend REST api for the project.

## Getting Started

Install poetry and install dependencies. Make sure a .env file is created based on `.env.backend.template.`
Run the app by running `start-flask`.

## Tests

The tests are in no way complete and are meant more for development purposes.
They will require a connection to a PSQL database and redis server to run.
